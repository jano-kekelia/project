        <h2>About Boxing</h2>
        <p>Boxing, also known as "The Sweet Science," is a combat sport in which two people, usually wearing protective gloves, throw punches at each other for a predetermined amount of time in a boxing ring. The aim is to land punches on the opponent while avoiding being hit themselves.</p>
